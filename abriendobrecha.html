  <h1>Call for Participants | Abriendo Brecha XIII | March 24-26, 2016 </h1>
  <h2>Embodying Activist Research: Race, Gender and Violence in the Field</h2>

  <p>
    The Abriendo Brecha organizing committee invites your participation in the 13th annual Activist Scholarship Conference, Embodying Activist Research: Race, Gender and Violence in the Field, at the University of Texas at Austin from March 24-26th, 2016.
  </p>

  <p>
    As scholars trained in the Austin School of Activist Research, we are invested in advancing the theory and praxis of politically engaged research informed by the experience of black, indigenous, mestiza, and queer researchers.
  </p>

  <p>
    This year’s conference brings together an interdisciplinary group of feminist scholar-activists to examine race and gender centered transformations of activist research methods. Two days of hands on, interactive workshops facilitated by leading and upcoming activist researchers will examine the following key themes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How critical race and feminist theory can challenge the assumed heteronormative white male activist researcher</li>
    <li>Ethical, political, and embodied implications of activist methods for Black, mestiza, indigenous, and queer researchers</li>
    <li>Encountering gender and sexual violence in the field</li>
    <li>New directions in decolonizing activist research methods</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The conference is free and open to the public, and will be convened at the African and African Diaspora Studies Department (AADS) at UT Austin.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to the conference, we invite doctoral students preparing for fieldwork to submit an application for Abriendo Brecha’s inaugural dissertation fieldwork workshop. The workshop will offer students the opportunity to fine-tune their doctoral research projects with seasoned scholars of activist anthropology in an intimate, engaged setting in preparation for fieldwork.
  </p>

  <p>
    Applicants from any discipline working on themes related to race, gender and violence are encouraged to apply by submitting a 500 word abstract of your dissertation project and 250 word statement about why you would like to participate to <a href="mailto:abriendobrecha2016@gmail.com?subject=Abriendo Brecha XIII">abriendobrecha2016@gmail.com</a> no later than <strong>February 10th, 2016</strong>.
  </p>
